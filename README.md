Implementation of a minimal computational model of HURP dynamics on K-fibres, as described in Castrogiovanni, Inchingolo et al (2021) "Microtubule-based mitotic spindles contain a micron-sized mixed-nucleotide zone" https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453504

The model is a partial differential equation model implementated in MATLAB.
